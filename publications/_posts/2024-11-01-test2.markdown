HydraViT introduces a **stacked‑head stochastic training** method for Vision Transformers, producing a single model that embeds up to **10 subnetworks**, each with varying head counts. It adapts dynamically to hardware constraints, yielding an ImageNet‑1K accuracy boost of up to **5 pp at equal GMACs** and **7 pp at equal throughput** versus state‑of‑the‑art baselines.
