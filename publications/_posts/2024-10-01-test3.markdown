MCUCoder is an **ultra‑lightweight** video compression model for low‑resource IoT devices and MCUs. Its encoder has only **10.5 K parameters** with a **350 KB memory footprint**, yet it achieves **~55.6% bitrate reduction** over M‑JPEG on MCL‑JCV and UVG datasets (MS‑SSIM) while maintaining similar energy efficiency. Crucially, it supports **adaptive bitrate streaming** by ordering latent channels by importance—enabling real‑time transmission under fluctuating bandwidth.
