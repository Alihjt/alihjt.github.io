LimitNet is a **progressive, content-aware encoder** for extremely weak IoT devices using LPWAN-style networks. It prioritizes and transmits only the most informative parts of an image, enabling cloud inference under severe bandwidth, packet loss, and device constraints—achieving up to **18 pp higher accuracy on CIFAR‑100** and **83% bandwidth savings** compared to SOTA.
